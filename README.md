# Distribution-Market-Access

## Problem Areas
### Awareness & Discovery
- Reliance on websites, social media, and partner networks may not reach marginalized applicants.
- Limited internet access and language barriers reduce visibility.
- In-person channels are effective but hard to scale.
### Application Preparation
- Applicants struggle with defining project goals, building teams, and budgeting.
- Lack of documentation (IDs, business registration, bank statements).
- Formatting and uploading errors during submissions.
- Limited application guidance and technical complexity.
### Submission & Screening
- Online-only portals create barriers for applicants with limited digital access.
- Multiple submissions, blank uploads, and tight deadlines cause errors.
- Screening remains manual, time-consuming, and lacks clear feedback loops.
### Evaluation & Contracting
- Panels struggle with aligning eligibility, budget checks, and applicant qualifications.
- Communication of status and feedback is delayed or unclear.
- Contracts are filled with legal/technical jargon that many applicants cannot easily interpret.
### Disbursement & Documentation
- Unbanked or mobile-shared applicants face fund access limitations.
- Difficulty tracking expenses due to low documentation culture (cash-based transactions, lack of receipts).
- Proof of payment remains a key barrier to transparent fund usage.
### Capacity Building & Follow-up
- One-size-fits-all training models (virtual, podcast, in-person) donâ€™t meet diverse needs.
- Timing conflicts (e.g., childcare, work hours) limit participation.
No centralized platform for ongoing impact reporting, storytelling, or investment readiness tracking.
